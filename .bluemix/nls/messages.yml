template.name: "Setup Marbles with an IBM Blockchain network"
template.description: "**Step 0.**\n Once created this toolchain will create the Marbles application and the blockchain network. But first we need to create the toolchain.  This will consist of a GitHub fork of Marbles, and a delivery pipeline for continuous integration. These items are already ready to go below. We can further configure these items at a later time. For now click the icons below \"Tool Integrations\" to familiarize yourself with what we are creating. Don't worry, you don't _need_ to change anything. \n\nThe components in this toolchain will be created and stored under the selected IBM Cloud organization/space.  Leave the org/space setting alone if you are unsure of which to use.  \n\n**Step 1.** To get going, click the **Create** button on the bottom.\n\n**Step 2 & 3.** On the next page you will be able to create and then open your Marbles application."
template.gettingStarted: "**Your toolchain is ready!**\nA new build is underway. Click the "Deliver" tile to see its status."
